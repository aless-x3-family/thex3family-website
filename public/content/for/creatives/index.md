## Why Creatives?

Creatives are people who believe that they have something to offer the world and want to make a living doing so. We understand that the journey can be hard, fraught with feelings of imposter syndrome and uncertainty about the next step. Our heros often seem unreachable, and larger than life. But the truth is, you have so much to offer, and we want to help you offer what you have to the world.

## How Do We Support Creatives?

### Understand Yourself

Start your journey by understanding yourself better with the [Better Life Framework](/understand-yourself). Its important for you to figure out what is driving you, so that you know how to orientate yourself to achieve what you actually want in life.

While helping others, you'll find people who want to join and support you in your mission.

*"I was first introduced to Our Family Without Borders when I visited Singapore for a few months as a student. The Castle provided me with a comfortable and welcoming environment that helped me feel at home right from the start. I learned a lot from the housemates and it was an unforgettable experience that helped me grow and made me think about life in ways that I had never considered before. The housemates were friendly and supportive, and we had many stimulating conversations that broadened my horizons."*

From business advice to coffee discussions, game development, and countless other topics, I learned a lot during our long dinners and late-night conversations.
