## How Did We Choose Who To Support?

We all tackle personal challenges in our lives, and as we resolve them, we try to support our family and friends. Many of us realized that our challenges were common to many people around the world. This realization sparked an idea: Why not extend these solutions to a wider community?

The best way to help others is to help yourself first, as many of the solutions you build will inevitably help someone like like you. So, we support people like ourselves, as we understand your challenges and want to help you on your growth journey.

## Key Personas We Support

Our organization is tailored to resonate with and uplift the following personas whose journeys we understand intimately:

| Personas     | How We Support                                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Students   | We empathize with not fitting in to the mold, and not knowing what we should do with our lives.  |
| Creatives  | We understand that chasing your passion isn't easy, and there's often no clear map towards success. |
| Retirees   | We know how difficult it can be to re-discover yourself and your passions as you enter retirement.  |


## Expanding Our Impact
