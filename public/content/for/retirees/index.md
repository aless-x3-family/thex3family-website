## Why Retirees?

Welcome to a community where we celebrate the journey of life's seasoned travelers – our beloved retirees. We fondly refer to you as "second winders," recognizing that you're not just at a crossroads but are poised for an exhilarating new adventure. Your years of dedication, hard work, and accumulated wisdom have brought you here, and now it's your time to shine anew.

At the Co-x3 Family Foundation, we understand that retirement isn't an end; it's a beginning. A beginning of self-discovery, of passions reignited, and of dreams yet to be realized. You've spent a lifetime nurturing others, contributing to your work, and building a legacy. 

Now, we invite you to focus on yourself – to explore, learn, and grow in ways you've always imagined.

## How Do We Support Retirees?

### Understand Yourself

Start your journey by understanding yourself better with the [Better Life Framework](/understand-yourself). Its important for you to figure out what is driving you now, so that you know how to orientate yourself to achieve what you actually want in life.

*"Knowing my passion for photography, I was seeking a platform that could provide the right tools and support. This community has been that and more. Co-x3 has a very nice buzz to it. It all feels very open and accepting but also hard-working and productive - and it's not always easy to combine those sets of attributes."*
