## Why Did We Build This?

In the complex game that is life, many people find themselves stuck on a level they can't seem to beat, overwhelmed by challenges and choices. They lack a systematic approach to navigate through life’s quests, leaving them unable to level up and pursue their best self. With a world full of advice yet lacking actionable plans, there's a glaring need for a tailored, interactive solution that can guide people to optimize the key "stats" of their lives.

## What Does it Do?

**Level Up** is a podcast that serves as your personal stat sheet, diving into key life areas like mindset, knowledge, finance, health, relationships, and career. It offers a targeted "systems audit," providing strategies to boost your "stats" and level up in life. 

You don’t just get theory; you get an actionable game plan to help you live a better life. At the end of each episode, guests will get real-life "quests" and challenges that encourage them to implement positive changes which they will come back onto the show in a period of time and discuss their progress.

Audience members can connect and see themselves with a diverse set of guests that come on this show, with their own unique dragons to slay; and walk away with motivation and tactics to level up.
