  Whether you're exploring this perspective to understand yourself better or to empathize with someone else's viewpoint, this guide is here to help. Remember, this perspective is just one way of looking at the world, and it's normal for us or others to experience it at different times in our lives. Think of this as a window into how we or they might be thinking and feeling.

## Introduction

When we step into the world of the 'Connect' perspective, we become acutely aware that others around us – people, animals, and even nature – have their senses, desires, and feelings, much like our own. We start to perceive and respond to these feelings, sometimes even mistaking them as our own. 

This perspective is underpinned by the belief that life is about pleasing others, from the people in our lives to larger entities like nature or the divine, in order to receive what we need in return.

## How This Perspective Develops

This perspective develops as we become more aware of the world around us and start to recognize that other beings have feelings and needs similar to ours. We begin to see the world as an interconnected web of relationships, where our actions can affect others and their reactions, in turn, can affect us. It's a shift from focusing solely on our own self for survival to understanding how we can thrive with a larger community or ecosystem.

## Historical Context

The foundations of the 'Connect' perspective can be traced back to the tribal order established around 50,000 years ago. During this era, the focus was primarily on keeping the group safe and happy, while also seeking to please the gods.

The goal was to ensure safety and security, maintaining functional habits and dependable practices that benefitted the group. This was achieved by preserving tribal traditions and engaging in rituals to petition the gods for favors.

## Strengths and Challenges

A major strength of this perspective lies in our ability to navigate others' emotions to meet our needs. We're particularly effective when these emotions are familiar to us, allowing us to empathize and connect deeply.

However, challenges arise when we encounter emotions or reactions different from our own. Misunderstandings can occur, leading to unmet needs or misaligned actions. The key challenge is in accurately interpreting and responding to the varied emotional landscapes of those around us.

## Unlock Your Potential

We can live better lives when we learn how to communicate with others to get what we need. You won't always be dealing with people that exhibit emotions the way you do, and thus the solutions that work to satisfy you may not work for them.

In such situations, knowing the tricks of communication is key to be able to speak properly to get what you need from the situations you find yourself in - even if you don't understand their feelings fully yet.

## Is It Time To Level Up?

If you're able to get what you need and have satisfied all your basic needs from yourself and others, you're ready to go to the ['Control' perspective](/unlock-your-potential/programs/guide-3). What you'll find is that most people are not here to satisfy your wants, and if you want to get what you want in life, you're going to need to get it yourself.
