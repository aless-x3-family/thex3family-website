## Why Did We Build This?

Have you ever listened to someone's story and found yourself puzzled, thinking, "How did they make it work?" or "Why did they choose that path?" Success stories often sound inspiring, but they can also feel distant and unattainable. 

Often times, people give advice without empathy of the perspective that their audience is in, and thus, their message falls on flat ears. It may be motivating to hear, but feel very hard to execute. 

What we really need is someone beside us as we're listening, breaking down these narratives for us into relatable, actionable insights tailored to our perspective.

## What Does it Do?

Now I Understand offers insightful commentary on various forms of media - be it podcasts, news, interviews, or historical and current events. Our aim is to dissect and interpret these narratives through the Better Life Framework, helping you grasp the underlying thought processes and strategies of individuals - and how it can work for you.

We're here to unravel the world's complexities, equipping you with the understanding and tools to appreciate others' perspectives and experiences. This series is all about creating these 'aha' moments where everything clicks, and you find yourself saying, "Ah, now I understand."
