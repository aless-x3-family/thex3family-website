## Why The 4A Model?

Understanding and processing experiences often require us to navigate through four distinct stages, known as the 4As: Avoidance, Awareness, Acceptance, and Action. These stages represent a journey towards greater self-awareness and effective problem-solving, crucial in times when we're not ready to engage in a conversation or confront a problem.

The 4A model is vital to pair together with the Better Life Framework because just having a framework isn't the end all - we also need to be in a state of mind to make it work for us.

## What Are The 4As?

|                        | Avoidance                                   | Awareness                                   | Acceptance                                | Action                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **How It Feels**       | Unwilling to engage; emotionally reactive   | Acknowledging emotions; feeling hurt        | Open to new perspectives                  | Ready for change and growth              |
| **Behaviour**          | Avoiding the situation; defensive           | Recognizing reactions; reluctant to change  | Empathizing; hesitant yet willing to change| Seeking and applying advice; proactive   |
| **Helpful Questions**  | What was the situation?                     | How do I feel about this?                   | How did we get to this situation?         | How have others solved this problem?      |

## Avoidance

In the Avoidance stage, there's a marked unwillingness to engage with the situation, often accompanied by reactive behavior. This stage is characterized by statements like "I don't know why I don't want to, it just is," leading to potential victimization. Asking "What was the situation?" helps to gradually open up to the reality of the circumstances.

In this stage, its hard to be helped. We need to sit with our feelings, so try avoiding using your phone, stress eating, or other coping behaviours.

## Awareness

During Awareness, we start recognizing our emotional responses to the situation, often focusing on self and accompanied by hurt feelings. Although there's an acknowledgment of our reactions, there's reluctance to change. "How do I feel about this?" is a helpful question in identifying and articulating emotions.

In this stage, you're more likely to seek [knowledge](/unlock-your-potential/knowledge/) that helps you feel heard and understood. 

## Acceptance

Acceptance involves recognizing that our initial reactions might not be the most constructive and developing empathy for others involved. It's about willingness to change, though often with hesitancy. "How did we get to this situation?" helps in understanding the factors that led to the situation in the first place. We may hypothesize childhood traumas, or repeated behaviours that is causing us to react in such a way.

In this stage, its useful to use [tools](/unlock-your-potential/tools/) to help you process the situation.

## Action

The Action stage is where we're ready to seek and accept advice, showing openness to solutions and different viewpoints. This stage is characterized by a preference for relatable advice and an active effort to apply learnings. The question "How have others solved this problem?" is crucial for moving forward with insights gained.

In this stage, its useful to go to a [community](/unlock-your-potential/community/) to help you take action.
