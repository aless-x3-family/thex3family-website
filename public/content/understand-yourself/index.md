## Why Create A Framework?

Understanding ourselves is a complex journey. We often grapple with our feelings and actions, leading to frustrations and misunderstandings when things don't go the way we want them too. And just when we think we've figured ourselves out, we encounter situations where other people act in ways we can't understand.

Additionally, seeking personal growth through available resources (books, articles, podcast, etc.) often leads to a realization - they lack personalization. The content we consume might only partially resonate with us, and what we learn can take on new meanings as we gain different perspectives over time.

### Challenges We Tackle

1. **One Size Doesn't Always Fit All**

   What works for one might not suit another. This can be disheartening, because we all strive to support and be supported effectively. We need to learn how to adapt our learnings so they can be readily absorbed by others.

2. **What Worked May Not Keep Working**

   We always hope that we will discover a permanant 'life hack' that will transform our life. The reality is that as we level up, so do our needs and motivations. Our strategies need to evolve over time to stay relevant and effective.

3. **We Feel Like We Are Wasting Our Time**

   Understanding why certain knowledge, tools, or community resources don't align with our current selves can prevent feelings of wasted time and effort. This helps keep up our motivation to pursue our best selves.

## What Is The Better Life Framework?

We integrated foundational theories in psychological and personal development to facilitate a deeper understanding of oneself and others. It presents nine unique levels, each characterized by distinct experiences and motivations, offering a comprehensive framework for impactful actions that help you live a better life.
