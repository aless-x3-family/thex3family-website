## Why Develop A Philosophy?

Our founder, [Conrad](https://conradl.in), wanted to solve a problem that has troubled him since young. Understanding ourselves is a complex journey. We often grapple with our feelings and actions, leading to frustrations and misunderstandings when things don't go the way we want them too. And just when we think we've figured ourselves out, we encounter situations where other people act in ways we can't understand.

Additionally, seeking personal growth through available resources (books, articles, podcast, etc.) often leads to a realization - they lack personalization. The content we consume might only partially resonate with us, and what we learn can take on new meanings as we gain different perspectives over time.

### Challenges We're Solving

What works for one might not suit another. This can be disheartening, because we all strive to support and be supported effectively. We need to learn how to adapt our learnings so they can be readily absorbed by others.

We always hope that we will discover a permanant 'life hack' that will transform our life. The reality is that as we level up, so do our needs and motivations. Our strategies need to evolve over time to stay relevant and effective.

## How Does A Philosophy Help Me?

You don't need to feel so helpless. Your perception of the world is your reality, and our philosophies will help you figure out where you need to look in order to unlock your potential. Additionally, leveling up doesn't need to be by chance. Knowing your perspective will help you access relevant programs as you need them, minimizing frustrations and setbacks.

<ExpandableCard title="Understand Why You Think The Way You Do" eventCategory="/understand-yourself" eventName="clicked solution 1" contentPreview="Understand how experiences shift your perspectives to leverage success from one area of life to another.">

Some people seem to have the Midas touch, achieving success in varied fields, while others struggle to translate their accomplishments from one domain to another. The key difference lies in their understanding of the the fundamentals of how they became successful, and appropriately applying it to other areas of their lives. Our philosophies help you breakdown the first principles behind success, so you know exactly why it happened, and what you need to do to get similar or better outcomes in the future.

<ExpandableCard title="Understand Human Behaviours" eventCategory="/understand-yourself" eventName="clicked solution 2" contentPreview="Gain a deeper understanding into why history repeats itself, and how we can leverage our experiences to work for us.">

Human behavior often follows recognizable patterns, and understanding these can be immensely empowering. Learning the intricacies of human thought processes allows you to decode behavioral patterns. This insight not only fosters empathy towards yourself and others but also equips you to influence outcomes more effectively, using your understanding to navigate the world around you.

<ExpandableCard title="Find True Happiness And Fulfillment" eventCategory="/understand-yourself" eventName="clicked solution 3" contentPreview="Learn how to maximize your happiness based on your needs and motivations, and level up whenever you are ready.">

Happiness and fulfillment are deeply personal experiences, shaped by our individual needs and desires. Philosophy doesn't offer a universal solution but rather guides you in identifying what happiness means to you. It provides strategies for aligning your life with these personal values, leading to a more authentic and satisfying journey of self-discovery and joy.
