## Why A Glossary?

The language of personal development is constantly evolving. We invite you to contribute to keeping our glossary current and comprehensive. Take a look at our existing [glossary](/glossary/) and see how you can contribute!

## Criteria for Glossary Terms {#criteria}

When adding new terms to the glossary, please consider the following criteria:

- **Relevance**: Is the term currently relevant and widely used in the context of personal development?
- **Uniqueness**: Does the term already exist in the glossary? If so, evaluate the need for a new term.
- **Objectivity**: Is the term and its definition presented objectively, without promotional content or subjective opinions?
- **Accuracy**: Is the definition precise, clear, and factually correct?
- **Credibility**: Are the sources of information credible and well-referenced?
