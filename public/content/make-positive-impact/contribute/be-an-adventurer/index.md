## What Is An Adventurer?

When we think about helping others, typically we imagine high-commitment engagements like volunteering at a soup kitchen, animal shelter, or local church. At the Co-x3 Family Foundation, we want to change the game, by gamifying positive contributions to the world. We want to make it easy for you to apply yourself and your unique skillset towards meaningful one-off or occasional tasks to support our programs helping people live better lives.

## Why Be An Adventurer?

Your contributions, regardless of their size, are immensely valuable to us. Whether you have a few minutes or several hours, there's a place for you here. Participation in even small, one-off tasks can make a significant impact.

## What Benefits Do I Get As An Adventurer?

Adventurers get access to unique gear to help them fulfill their mission, which can be used for personal endeavors as well. This includes free access to productivity tools, automation platforms, and much more.

When you complete tasks, you'll be rewarded publicly and build up stats within the community. If you ever need to share your experience with prospective employers, you'll get a profile with your specific contributions, so they know exactly how you've been helping out the community.

High-performing adventurers may also be offered [collaborator](/make-positive-impact/collaborators) roles in the community, opening up opportunities to turn their passions into full-time careers.
